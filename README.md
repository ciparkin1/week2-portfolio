# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio
## This week's task is to create a web application for my personal portfolio page, I will then add to this portfolio as the course progresses. My portfolio will highlight what kind of work I am looking for i.e. full / part time. It will include my hobbies and interests and my professional achievements to date.Â As I continue to work on my portfolio I will ensure that it showcases my applications and highlights my strengths.
